This file is created for basic understanding and concepts of linear regression line.
We take built-in data from python library of Diabetes.
After taking data we had consider single feature (Indexing =2).
Reason is to understand regression line and get line after plotting on graph.

Note: For better and accurate result we take all features but regression line will not be shown in that scenario. So for regression line we will indexing any specific key
and by help of matplotlib we can visualize our data and linear regression line.

Test Regression.py file has only one feature and also have linear regression line, means squared error, coefficient and intercept values in output result.
Test Regression2.py file has all features of data and has output of means squared error, coefficient and intercept values

Check both file.

The Data is collected built-in from DataSets in python (datasets.load_diabetes()).

Thanks for your time & do support and add your suggestions.    :)
